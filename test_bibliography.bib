    abstract  = {Ethnic identity is central to many contemporary discussions of belonging and assimilation of migrant-origin youth. Studies typically focus on a single minority identity. Identity theory implies, however, that individuals may hold multiple ethnic identities, or none, and these may find expression to a greater or less extent depending on context. Using a nationally representative, longitudinal study of Dutch teenagers, we investigate the role of classroom ethnic composition in shaping multiple ethnic identity expression. Framing identity choices as a relational process, we show that the number of ethnic identities that children with a migrant-origin background choose is greater for those students who are exposed to a more ethnically diverse context, while less diverse classrooms foster ethnic identification with no or fewer minority groups. Classification of migrant-origin students with a single (minority) ethnicity may thus be an oversimplification of ethnic identity, even for those from a single country of origin.},

At the same time, there are limits to our understanding of this phenomenon in multiparty contexts. How do citizens draw the line between 'ingroups' and 'outgroups' in fragmented contexts with multiple parties? Answering this question has been hampered by a relative lack of data on citizens' views towards compatriots with opposing political views outside the US. This study is based on original data collection, measuring citizens’ evaluations of various political and non-political outgroups among a population-representative sample of 1071 Dutch citizens. These data allow to study the extent and configuration of affective polarization in the highly fragmented context of the Netherlands. The analysis shows that respondents do distinguish between parties and partisans. They report more dislike towards political outgroups than towards almost all non-political outgroups. Rather than disliking all out-partisans equally, evaluations grow gradually colder as ideological distance towards a group increases. Affective polarization is especially strong between those who disagree on cultural issues, and between those who support and oppose the populist radical right. The article discusses how these findings enhance our understanding of affective polarization in multiparty systems.},

Mosque education is perceived by many as contributing to integration by teaching the children values of respect and tolerance, offering positive identity affirmation to children’s stigmatized Islamic identity and countering youth radicalization by providing messages of moderation.

The contemporary operative taxonomy has until recently been binary: autochtoon (of Dutch heritage) and allochtoon (of foreign birth). Used earlier at the provincial level in respect of internal migration, the taxonomy was expanded in 1999 to demarcate between 'Western' allochtoon and 'non-Western' allochtoon, with the latter being further subdivided into first and second generation. Informed by a 'generative metaphor' approach (Schon 1979) that links cognition to action, this article subjects the allochtoon/autochtoon binary to metaphor analysis and the Western/non-Western taxonomy to category analysis. The work done by 'birthplace' in the term pair suggests that they are, in their everyday usage, surrogates for a race discourse, carrying the same (ancient) assumptions about individual identity and the earth-air-sun-water of the spot on which one was born that underlies definitions-in-use of 'race'. Their meaning in contemporary policy discourse derives from the interaction of metaphoric and category structures, with implications for policy implementation. © 2013 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.},

Through a novel approach that makes use of naturalisation processes as an empirical entry point into the narratives of citizenship embraced by Turkish migrants, this article investigates the role of dual citizenship policies in three European countries: Spain, the Netherlands and the UK. The evidence from the sample group displays a process of ‘self-bargaining’ prior to the naturalisation decision, which calls into question the link established between legal and emotional bonds of citizenship. The Dutch example demonstrates how Turkish migrants cope with the ban on dual citizenship by downplaying the identity-conferring role of citizenship status. This leads to a decoupling of legal and emotional aspects of citizenship and thereby to the adoption of a thin sense of citizenship. While Spain represents an in-between case that has a tolerant implementation despite a de jure ban, the British example shows how the process of ‘self-bargaining’ can result in the widening of emotional landscape, when dual citizenship is allowed. A thick sense of citizenship is therefore not only preserved but it can also be extended to the citizenship of the country of residence.},

This paper addresses this gap by documenting cultural discourses of whiteness infusing a diverse primary school classroom in Amsterdam. Discourses reflecting white cultural norms of order, time, cleanliness, and Western and Christian superiority dominated a classroom containing only one white Dutch child. These discourses contribute to diverse students' explicit racialization while promoting the supremacy of white Dutch culture. They are both assimilationist and exclusionary, suggesting that many students, because of their backgrounds, will never be considered fully Dutch.

However, the positive association between respect tolerance and acceptance of practices was weaker for people who were more strongly concerned about the continuity of their national cultural identity. Overall, the more pragmatic coexistence tolerance was found to have no independent association with prejudicial feelings and with the acceptance of minority practices.

Second, this is one of the first studies that assess who supports populism and why they do so.

Instead, attention is given to a re-articulation of the very notion of nationhood.

This discourse not merely embellishes talk of Dutchness with new terms, but indicates – so the articles aim to demonstrate – a different conception of nationhood all together. Apart from what the nation is – about which very little disagreement took place – discussions formed about how Dutchness was imagined and to what extent people themselves were able to form a national image. The emergence of national-identity discourse is empirically reconstructed. Not only is it made clear how a logic of popularity begins to be reiterated across a variety of positionings, but public debate and dissensus acquire a new significance and performativity in the process.},

The two different configurations of diversity found, i.e. commonplace diversity and essentialist diversity, question superdiversity’s heuristic value. First, students do not experience diversity as something exciting or ‘super’ or positive, as superdiversity authors suggest. Their main concerns, i.e. to enjoy education and to construct their identities in line with institutional demands, are not covered by the notion of superdiversity. Second, key descriptive meanings associated with superdiversity do not make sense to these configurations of diversity, i.e. discarding the ethno-focal lens and expectations of more or new and multilayered complexity. Findings point to conviviality, creolization, ethnic boundaries and groupism, not to superdiversity.},

It further calls for a differentiated understanding of migrants’ precarity, questions explanations of ethnic closure in terms of stereotypes and critically scrutinises socio-psychological approaches of ethnicity and diversity management.},

Drawing on 2,783 newspaper articles published between 1994 and 2012 and matched samples, we find that the media structurally emphasize the identities of all parliamentarians who are not white men. Women politicians are more often described in terms of gender, ethnic minorities in terms of ethnicity and Muslim politicians in terms of religion. Ethnic majority men, meanwhile, are most often described by their political ideology. We find that this works already for one minority identity, as well as multiple identities. By continuously highlighting the identities of politicians that diverge from the norm, the media, we argue, paint pictures of women and ethnic minority politicians as different and out of place.}

Social network interviews were conducted with Dutch-Moroccan inner-city teenagers, probing their online and offline identity practices as related to their actual social networks. Social network analysis was applied, assuming that structural properties of networks affect behaviour; they can limit or shape, but do not fully determine the actions that individuals can engage in. By combining numeric, discursive and visual data, we aim to understand how structural and compositional aspects of networks are related to the ways in which youth create opportunities for identity development. Four network types, with associated (online) identity practices, are presented.},

In line with theories of intersectionality, we expected intragroup identity construction to be influenced by the specific location of participants in a matrix of intersecting identity categories. Narratives were elicited in focus groups that varied by gender and by the educational level of the participants. We compared the content and import of stories in each group. We found that participants across groups told similar stories in which they referred to the treatment of their group at a societal level. However, we also found that the intersection of ethnicity, gender, and level of educational attainment influenced the way our participants narrated their everyday experiences, and, in particular, their relations with native Dutch neighbors, fellow students, and coworkers. An intersectional analysis shows how, faced with negative stereotypes regarding their ethnic and religious background, Moroccan-Dutch young adults variously accept, reject, and act in relation to those stereotypes.},

The aim of this article is threefold. First, it criticizes the linear and simplistic assumptions of integration informing the present negative dominant discourse in the Netherlands. Second, it shows that sources of belonging are more layered than the often-assumed exclusive identification with national identity. Third, it broadens the scope of discussion on integration (which is now mainly fixated on Islamic migrants) by showing the somewhat similar experiences of Italian migrants on their path toward integration and belonging within the Dutch context. Through this study, we argue that the process of ethnic othering in the Netherlands is broader than the often-assumed cultural difference of non-Western migrants.},

However, empirical studies in this field are often based on interviewer-interviewee interaction or focus on interactions with members of a socially dominant out-group. How identities are negotiated in interaction with in-group members remains understudied. In this article we use a narrative approach to study identity negotiation among Moroccan-Dutch young adults, who constitute both an ethnic and a religious (Muslim) minority in the Netherlands. Our analysis focuses on the topics that appear in focus group participants' stories and on participants' responses to each other's stories. We find that Moroccan-Dutch young adults collectively narrate their experiences in Dutch society in terms of discrimination and injustice. Firmly grounded in media discourse and popular wisdom, a collective narrative of a disadvantaged minority identity emerges. However, we also find that this identity is not uncontested. We use the concept of second stories to explain how participants negotiate their collective identity by alternating stories in which the collective experience of deprivation is reaffirmed with stories in which challenging or new evaluations of the collective experience are offered. In particular, participants narrate their personal experiences to challenge recurring evaluations of discrimination and injustice. A new collective narrative emerges from this work of joint storytelling. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Also German immigrants report lower perceived discrimination than Eastern European immigrants.

Using French descendants as a placebo treatment and sub-Saharan African descendants as a benchmark treatment, we find severe levels of hiring discrimination against Southern European descendants in both Norway and the Netherlands, but not in Germany.

In many European states the turn to “civic” measures and discourses has been deemed more suitable for the objectives of minority integration and the promotion of preferred modes of social and political unity. It is therefore said that the first decade of the new century has been characterized by a reorientation in immigrant integration policies—from liberal culturalist to the “return of assimilation” (Brubaker, 2001), on route to a broader “retreat from multiculturalism” (Joppke, 2004). In this article, we argue that such portrayals mask a tendency that is more complicated in some cases and much less evident in others. To elaborate this, we offer a detailed account of the inception and then alleged movement away from positions in favor of multiculturalism in two countries that have adopted different versions of it, namely the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, and two countries that have historically rejected multiculturalism, namely Denmark and Germany. We argue that while there is undoubtedly a rhetorical separation between multiculturalism and civic integration, the latter is in some cases building on the former, and broadly needs to be understood as more than a retreat of multiculturalism. Taking seriously Banting and Kymlicka’s argument that understanding the evolution of integration requires the “the mind-set of an archaeologist,” we offer a policy genealogy that allows us to set the backlash against multiculturalism in context, in manner that explicates its provenance, permutations, and implications.},

Schooling and integration in religious groups only affect specific forms of national celebrations and commemorations.

By dissecting it into its three constitutive dimensions – constructivism, lightness and essentialism – we show how this image of Dutchness is evoked precisely through the simultaneous rejection of ‘bad’ and enactment of ‘good’ nationalism.

Furthermore, in all schools there was limited reflection on being different in relation to teachers and the broader community. Finally, relevant differences for citizenship were confined to the category of ‘ethnic and cultural diversity’. This article calls for preparing teachers to consider a broader array of differences to practice dealing with differences with their students and to support students in reflecting on the societal implications of being different from each other.},

    abstract  = {On 12 July 2018, the central government of the Netherlands changed its approach relating to traveller camps in the Netherlands. This change constitutes a huge political shift, as the government had previously adopted a 'hands-off' and 'repressive-inclusion' strategy, which was especially known for its infamous 'phase-out policy' or 'extinction policy' of traveller camps. This has now been replaced by a fundamental rights-proof approach that facilitates the travellers' way of life. This article aims to uncover the various actions undertaken by international and national actors that seem to have contributed to the Dutch government's changed stance. It looks particularly at the role played by four national actors: The Netherlands Institute for Human Rights, the National Ombudsman, the Public Interest Litigation Project, and activist Roma, Sinti and travellers and their various interest groups. The article concludes that these actors' efforts to establish political and legal change were successful as they addressed the same issue from different vantage points and through different means.

This study takes place in a context, the Netherlands, where Islam is popularly considered by the native Dutch population, as a religion oppressive to women. How do these Dutch Muslim women build their identity in a way that it is both Dutch and Muslim? Do they mix Dutch parameters in their Muslim identity, while at the same time, inter-splicing Islamic principles in their Dutch sense of self? This study is based on an ethnography conducted in the city of Amsterdam from September to October 2009, which combines insights taken from in-depth interviews with Dutch Muslim women, observations from Quranic and Religious classes, observations in a mosque, and one-time events occurring during the month of Ramadan. This paper argues that, in the context of being Dutch and Muslim, women express their agency, which is their ability to choose and act in social action: they push the limits of archetypal Dutch identity while simultaneously stretching the meaning of Islam to craft their own identity, one that is influenced by themes of immigration, belongingness, religious knowledge, higher education and gender.},

I apply Simmel's concept of sociability to the bonding that occurs among ethnic networks at both the community and global levels. I argue for the need to separate the sociability elements of enjoyment and pleasure in time and place. I focus on the diaspora tourism of Dutch Hindustanis to show that joy and pleasure occur both when shopping in India and when giving gifts in the Netherlands. Furthermore , I argue that gifts purchased in India create bonding within close ethnic circles. As a result, these gifts become part of the material culture of the group, contributing to a feeling of home, ethnic consciousness and transnational bonds. Finally, I suggest that this joy and pleasure can be repeated because many of these moments are recorded with video cameras and photographs. Through this analysis, I demonstrate that trans-national sociability, exemplified in diaspora tourism (specifically in shopping and gift giving), generates bonding both at the ethnic group and global level. I thus aim to add specificity to studies of transnational ethnic networks.},

This discourse suggests that generations of migrants living inside the nation are constructed as not belonging to it. This “sedentary bias” produces dichotomies of rootedness in the places of origin and uprootedness in countries where generations of migrants presently live. When normalized, this positioning limits differentiated, multilayered, and multi-sited possibilities of belonging.

As Dutch society has become more multicultural, partly due to the immigration from the former Dutch colonies in the West-Indies, new sensitivities have arisen about this institutionalised heritage practice. At the core of the controversy is the figure of Black Pete (Zwarte Piet), Saint Nicholas’ black-faced companion. Some communities within Dutch society perceive this figure as highly menacing and insulting. To the majority of the population, however, Zwarte Piet is an essential part of its heritage and identity. The ensuing controversy can be understood as a matter of heritage narratives conflicting. These narratives do not just give meaning to the tradition, but are also instrumentalized by actors in the debate to achieve their goals. They are used to justify or reject the appearance of Zwarte Piet, and to critically debate Dutch identity. In this article we reconstruct the Zwarte Piet narratives, and explain why these are so incommensurable. Naturally, we also pay attention to what is at stake for the activists on all sides.},

We propose to build on the recent social movement literature that stresses institutional and discursive opportunities and constraints that challenger groups face in attempting to realize social change. The opportunity structure with regard to the political-cultural integration of ethnic minorities is determined by the definitions of national identity and citizenship in the countries under investigation. After a detailed description of both the individual (i.e. access to individual citizenship rights) and collective (i.e. group rights and obligations tied to the national concept of citizenship) dimensions of citizenship in each of the three countries, we conclude that the Dutch and British integration regimes can best be defined as individually civic and collectively pluralist while the German regime most resembles the individually ethnic and collectively monist model. We then proceed to establish the effect of this difference on the political claims by ethnic minorities by employing the method of political claims analysis. Our findings support the expectations that the Dutch and British models of citizenship render ethnic minorities' political claims more publicly visible, moderate their action repertoire and stimulate a focus on the politics of the country of settlement more than the German model. Furthermore, the identity of the claimants reflects the integration policies in all three countries. However, further investigation into the different nature of multicultural policies in the Netherlands and Britain suggests that there is a limit to the beneficial effects of cultural pluralism.},

At the same time, not much is known about how these positions relate to pre-migration, migration and post-migration characteristics, while these could be key indicators of early acculturation. This study explores Syrian refugees’ socio-cultural starting positions by using a unique dataset including 3209 Syrian refugees in the Netherlands from which we develop a typology based on various indicators: Syrian's social contacts, emotional ties and cultural value orientation, both within and outside their origin group. A Latent Class Analysis showed that though Syrian refugees have been in the Netherlands shortly, they can be divided into three distinct socio-cultural types; the ‘origin secured’, ‘double bonds’ and ‘destination focused’ type. Latent class regression analysis provided insight into pre-migration, migration and post-migration indicators associated with Syrian's socio-cultural types. Having attended university before arrival, experiencing acceptance by receiving society members, being mentally stable and speaking Dutch indicated socio-cultural embedding (the ‘destination focused’ type). Syrians who were students in Syria, stayed in reception longer and participated in activities less and those who were not going to school in the Netherlands were more likely to belong to the ‘origin secured’ type.},

I find that while the large majority of Dutch political parties adopt authoritarian positions on the sociocultural axis in favour of state intervention to protect Dutch culture and identity, their positions diverge significantly on the classic economic Left-Right dimension. The most contentious issue in Dutch civic integration politics is whether the state, the market or individual migrants should be responsible for financing and organising courses.

By way of discussing these four routes, the article argues that the different theoretical perspectives should not be seen as an either/or choice, but that they need to be combined.

Domain specificity of acculturation played a more central role in the implicit theories of Turkish-Dutch than typically assumed in current theoretical models. The unidimensional domain-specific model was most frequently employed. Turkish-Dutch emphasized the importance of both Dutch and Turkish culture in their lives (thereby supporting the popular notion of integration), but this importance varied across domains: Adjustment to Dutch culture was more emphasized in the public (functional, utilitarian) domain while maintenance of Turkish culture was more emphasized in the private (social-emotional, value-related) domain.

In this commentary, we address such epochal (“large-scale”) questions by way of a (situated) experiment: at the Danish Technical University in Copenhagen, an interdisciplinary group of computer scientists, physicists, economists, sociologists, and anthropologists (including the authors) is setting up a large-scale data infrastructure, meant to continually record the digital traces of social relations among an entire freshman class of students (N > 1000). At the same time, fieldwork is carried out on friendship (and other) relations amongst the same group of students. On this basis, the question we pose is the following: what kind of knowledge is obtained on this social micro-cosmos via the Big (computational, quantitative) and Small (embodied, qualitative) Data, respectively? How do the two relate? Invoking Bohr’s principle of complementarity as analogy, we hypothesize that social relations, as objects of knowledge, depend crucially on the type of measurement device deployed. At the same time, however, we also expect new interferences and polyphonies to arise at the intersection of Big and Small Data, provided that these are, so to speak, mixed with care. These questions, we stress, are important not only for the future of social science methods but also for the type of societal (self-)knowledge that may be expected from new large-scale social databases.}

This strategy, we argue, relies on a set of unwarranted assumptions, namely, that unsupervised models return natural clusters of meaning, that the researcher can understand text with limited immersion and that indirect validation is sufficient for ensuring unbiased and precise measurement. In response to this criticism, we develop a framework that is computer assisted. We argue that our reformulation of computational grounded theory better aligns with the principles within grounded theory, anthropological theory generation and ethnography.}

It relates, on the one hand, to categories of the individual or sameness with oneself and, on the other, to collective distinctions of otherness. It is both a practice and a process of cognitive classification. It is fluid and transcends boundaries but, to a certain degree, has to be stable in order for others to identify one as theirs. Furthermore, it is at the same time a public discourse and an obvious phenomenon in the world and is thus an object of inquiry if not an analytical category. Most prominent among the many identity aspects we employ is probably the ethnic one, which hinges on a bundle of markers used to distinguish each other in presumed cultural terms, always embedded in power games that try to secure political support and loyalty.}

We define and exemplify this genre by tracing and tracking the single political idea and activist slogan of grøn genstart (‘green restart’) across Twitter and other public–political domains. Specifically, we achieve our micro-history through an iterative and mutual attuning between computational and netnographic registers and techniques, in ways that contribute to the nascent field of computational anthropology. By documenting the serial ways in and different steps through which our inquiry was continually fed and enhanced by crossing over from (n)ethnographic observation to computational exploration, and vice versa, we offer up our grøn genstart case account as exemplary of wider possibilities in this line of inquiry. In particular, we position the genre of micro-history of ideas in real-time within the increasingly wide and heterogeneous space of digital social research writ large, including its established concerns with ‘big and broad’ social data, the repurposing of computational ‘interface’ techniques for socio-cultural research, as well as diverse aspirations for deploying digital data within novel combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods.}

Despite its foundationally inductive mathematical assumptions, machine learning is currently developing alongside traditionally deductive inferential statistics but largely orthogonally to inductive, qualitative, cultural, and intersectional research—to its detriment. I argue that we can better realize the full potential of machine learning by leveraging the epistemological alignment between machine learning and inductive research. I empirically demonstrate this alignment through a word embedding model of first-person narratives of the nineteenth-century U.S. South. Situating social categories in relation to social institutions via an inductive computational analysis, I find that the cultural and economic spheres discursively distinguished by race in these narratives, the domestic sphere distinguished by gender, and Black men were afforded more discursive authority compared to white women. Even in a corpus over-representing abolitionist sentiment, I find white identities were afforded a status via culture not allowed Black identities.}

These approaches perform well on tasks like information extraction, but their ability to identify complex, socially constructed, and unsettled theoretical concepts—a central goal of sociological content analysis—has not been tested. To fill this gap, we compare the results produced by three common computer-assisted approaches—dictionary, supervised machine learning (SML), and unsupervised machine learning—to those produced through a rigorous hand-coding analysis of inequality in the news (N = 1,253 articles). Although we find that SML methods perform best in replicating hand-coded results, we document and clarify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, including how they can complement one another. We argue that content analysts in the social sciences would do well to keep all these approaches in their toolkit, deploying them purposefully according to the task at hand.}

Instead of trying to position ethnography as a discipline that provides deep insights to human behaviour (which we often call ‘the why’), while Big Data offers broad accounts based on large data collection, I make the case that both approaches should be seen as being positioned within an ethnographic space. This is because both ethnography and Big Data are interested in human behaviour and the cultural field and both are interested in generating insights. We should therefore situate Big Data and ethnography as a relationship that exists in a new epistemological field, a field that is both interpretative and data driven. This field I call ‘Big Ethnographic Data.}

    abstract = {Supervised machine learning is a promising methodological innovation for content analysis (CA) to approach the challenge of ever-growing amounts of text in the digital era. Social scientists have pointed to accurate measurement of category proportions and trends in large collections as their primary goal. Proportional classification, for example, allows for time-series analysis of diachronic data sets or correlation of categories with text-external covariates. We evaluate the performance of two common approaches for this goal: a method based on regression analysis with feature profiles from entire collections and a method aggregating classifier decisions for individual documents. For both, we observed a significant negative effect on classification performance due to the uneven distribution of characteristic language structures within the text collection. For proportional classification, this poses considerable problems. To fix this problem, we propose a workflow of active learning, which alternates between machine learning and human coding. Results from experiments with empirical data (political manifestos) demonstrate that active learning enables researchers to create training sets for automatic CA efficiently, reliably, and with high accuracy for the desired goal while retaining control over the automatic process.}

On the basis of approximately 140,000 tweets from the period between February 24 and April 28, 2020, harvested from Danish Twitter, this report explores how tweeting about mis/trust on this digital platform can be understood as a kind of biopolitical nationalism. Combining computational and qualitative methods, we identify shifting performances of mis/trust and other affects on Danish Twitter and suggest that this “affective public” plays a key role in the public response to the coronavirus crisis.}

Early computational approaches to language research focused on automating the analysis of the linguistic structure of language and developing basic technologies such as machine translation, speech recognition, and speech synthesis. Today’s researchers refine and make use of such tools in real-world applications, creating spoken dialogue systems and speech-to-speech translation engines, mining social media for information about health or finance, and identifying sentiment and emotion toward products and services.

Yet, it has proven difficult to bring these important insights into the practice of data science itself. We suggest that part of this problem has to do with under-examined or unacknowledged assumptions about the relationship between the two fields—ideas about how data science and its critics can and should relate. Inspired by recent work in Science and Technology Studies on interventions, we attempted to stage an encounter in which practicing data scientists were asked to analyze a corpus of critical social science literature about their work, using tools of textual analysis such as co-word and topic modelling. The idea was to provoke discussion both about the content of these texts and the possible limits of such analyses. In this commentary, we reflect on the planning stages of the experiment and how responses to the exercise, from both data scientists and qualitative social scientists, revealed some of the tensions and interactions between the normative positions of the different fields. We argue for further studies which can help us understand what these interdisciplinary tensions turn on—which do not paper over them but also do not take them as given.}

    abstract = {In their ‘Critical Questions for Big Data’, danah boyd and Kate Crawford warn: ‘Taken out of context, Big Data loses its meaning’. In this short commentary, I contextualize this claim about context. The idea that context is crucial to meaning is shared across a wide range of disciplines, including the field of ‘context-aware’ recommender systems. These personalization systems attempt to take a user’s context into account in order to make better, more useful, more meaningful recommendations. How are we to square boyd and Crawford’s warning with the growth of big data applications that are centrally concerned with something they call ‘context’? I suggest that the importance of context is uncontroversial; the controversy lies in determining what context is. Drawing on the work of cultural and linguistic anthropologists, I argue that context is constructed by the methods used to apprehend it. For the developers of ‘context-aware’ recommender systems, context is typically operationalized as a set of sensor readings associated with a user’s activity. For critics like boyd and Crawford, context is that unquantified remainder that haunts mathematical models, making numbers that appear to be identical actually different from each other. These understandings of context seem to be incompatible, and their variability points to the importance of identifying and studying ‘context cultures’–ways of producing context that vary in goals and techniques, but which agree that context is key to data’s significance. To do otherwise would be to take these contextualizations out of context.}

Yet, it is commonly practiced as a solitary endeavor and primary data is not often subject to scholarly scrutiny. In this paper, I suggest a model in which to understand the different ways in which ethnographies can be transparent – naming places, naming people, and sharing data – and the varied decisions ethnographers have made with regard to them: whether to name a region, city or specific neighborhood, name primary participants or public officials, and to share interview guides, transcripts, or different kinds of field notes. In doing so, this paper highlights how decisions regarding transparency are part of an ethnographer’s methodological toolkit, and should be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the who, what, where, when and why of our research.}

In contrast, data from ethnographic fieldwork follows a limited number of individuals but can provide the context often lacking from big data. Yet, there is an under-explored potential in combining ethnographic data with big data and other digital data sources. This paper presents ways that quantitative research designs can combine big data and ethnographic data and account for the synergies that such combinations can provide. We highlight the differences and similarities between ethnographic data and big data, focusing on the three dimensions: individuals, depth of information, and time. We outline how ethnographic data can validate big data by providing a “ground truth” and complement it by giving a “thick description.” Further, we lay out ways that analysis carried out using big data could benefit from collaboration with ethnographers, and we discuss the potential within the fields of machine learning and causal inference.}

Notwithstanding this European pattern, government policies are implemented differently and belonging to the nation comes to involve different images and enactments across contexts. In the Netherlands, especially, belonging to the nation is at stake in many high-profile public and political struggles. In this context, a pervasive public imaginary we call ‘dialogical Dutchness’ represents the Dutch as distinctly anti-nationalist and open to difference. This raises the question whether national boundaries actually become traversable in view of such a national imaginary. How does one become a Dutch subject if Dutchness entails not being nationalist? Through the analysis of a Dutch social policy practice – state-provided parenting courses – we show how dialogical Dutchness is negotiated and transformed in actual enactments of national difference and belonging. Although dialogical Dutchness foregrounds openness to difference and valorises discussion, it comes to perpetuate and substantiate boundaries between those who belong to the nation and those whose belonging is still in question.}

Using an ethnographic case study of cycling courses in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, I use Ryan Centner’s work on spatial capital to understand how privileged local inhabitants can consume and imbue public spaces with their own spatial practices and perceptions. It becomes apparent that women perceived as Muslim lack spatial capital because of others’ perceptions of their nonbelonging, here against a backdrop of local “Dutch” spaces, what I call “spatial poverty.” This concept calls attention to the racialized narratives of national belonging in the local uses of public places, highlighting the role of everyday white majority community members as state actors.}

Tracing the racial genealogy of the immigrant through European and Europeanist migration studies, the successive construction of overlapping tropes of the nomad, the laborer, the uprooted victim, the hybrid cosmopolite, and the (Muslim) transmigrant are examined. This history points to the perduring problematization of the immigrant as the object of national integration. If migration studies have effectively tended to racialize migrants into a new savage slot, recent ethnographies of the immigrant experience in Europe point to ways in which immigrant and diasporic groups cross racial frontiers and enact solidarity across class and cultural lines.}

Local bureaucrats who organize the ceremony initially disapproved of the measure as symbolic of the neonationalist approach to migration. I analyze how their criticism is undermined in the process of designing the ritual, the form of which continues to express a culturalist message of citizenship, despite organizers' explicit criticism or ridicule. Using the concept of "cultural intimacy," I show how nationalism builds on a shared embarrassment among local bureaucrats, from which the new citizens are excluded by way of the ceremony.}

The hierarchy places value on immigrants in Finland based on their ethnicity, socio-economic status, and various other interlinking factors, dividing them into differently valued categories. Against this framework, the relevance of such a hierarchy to the everyday lives of highly skilled migrants in Finland is explored, using data from ethnographic fieldwork and interviews. The data are used to describe these migrants’ experiences of being categorized and perceived as particular types of immigrants, and the relevance of these experiences to their social lives and their self-defined group identities. The data show, firstly, that highly skilled migrants in Finland are aware of the migrant hierarchy, and that it has an impact on their lives. Secondly, although they object to its homogenizing and hierarchizing aspects, the categorizations of the hierarchy are still internalized to a certain extent, affecting identity constructions. Exploring these issues reveals boundaries that imply underlying problems in regards to the social integration and feelings of belonging by highly skilled migrants in Finland.}},

    abstract = {As North America begins to emerge from the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, companies are turning up their investment dollars. This investment includes a renewed focus on what might loosely be called “the customer experience.” In our recent consulting engagements, this focus often comes in the form of a clearly stated client demand for a very unclear concept – a “360 view of my customer.” The metaphor conjures up a pantopticonal image of customer beliefs and behaviors which would precipitate a perfectly calibrated set of products and services. Ethnographic practice would, one would think, be well positioned to support this renewed focus on experience. However, we have found that the conversation about customer experience typically begins – and ends – with analytics and business intelligence. The metaphor of a “360 view of my customer” has led to an emphasis on data acquisition, with less of a focus on experiential understanding. That said, data modeling can be fruitfully employed with the interpretive practices of ethnography – as long as the focus returns to experience and away from data hoarding.}

Such sensor-based personality assessment promises novel and often technologically sophisticated ways to unobtrusively measure individual differences in a highly precise, granular, and faking-resistant manner. We review the different conceptual underpinnings of PC; survey how well different types of sensors can capture different types of personality-relevant information; discuss the evaluation of PC performance and psychometric issues (reliability and validity) of sensor-derived scores as well as ethical, legal, and societal implications; and highlight how modern personality and computer science can be married more effectively to provide practically useful personality assessment. Together, this review aims to introduce readers to the opportunities, challenges, pitfalls, and implications of PC.}

    abstract = {{To what degree can we determine people's connections with groups through the language they use? In recent years, large archives of behavioral data from social media communities have become available to social scientists, opening the possibility of tracking naturally occurring group identity processes. A feature of most digital groups is that they rely exclusively on the written word. Across 3 studies, we developed and validated a language-based metric of group identity strength and demonstrated its potential in tracking identity processes in online communities. In Studies 1a–1c, 873 people wrote about their connections to various groups (country, college, or religion). A total of 2 language markers of group identity strength were found: high affiliation (more words like we, togetherness) and low cognitive processing or questioning (fewer words like think, unsure). Using these markers, a language-based unquestioning affiliation index was developed and applied to in-class stream-of-consciousness essays of 2,161 college students (Study 2). Greater levels of unquestioning affiliation expressed in language predicted not only self-reported university identity but also students’ likelihood of remaining enrolled in college a year later. In Study 3, the index was applied to naturalistic Reddit conversations of 270,784 people in 2 online communities of supporters of the 2016 presidential candidates—Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. The index predicted how long people would remain in the group (3a) and revealed temporal shifts mirroring members’ joining and leaving of groups (3b). Together, the studies highlight the promise of a language-based approach for tracking and studying group identity processes in online groups.}},

We conduct a series of correlation analyses between the resulting MBTI data and explore their connection to other signals, such as for Big-5 traits, emotion, sentiment, age, and gender. The analysis shows intriguing correlation patterns between different personality dimensions and other traits, and also provides evidence for the robustness of the data.}

We conducted a wide-ranging review of this literature with the aim of presenting an overarching framework that comprehensively summarizes and integrates the vast amount of recent research in this domain. Drawing on our analysis of the empirical literature, we present an enhanced conceptual understanding of identity work. We then summarize the four dominant theoretical approaches researchers have used to explain how, when, and why individuals engage in identity work. This side-by-side comparison of these theoretical perspectives allows us to parse out the unique contribution of each theoretical lens and highlights how these theories can be integrated into a holistic view of an inherently multifaceted concept. Lastly, we critically analyze the state of the field and lay a detailed roadmap for future researchers to draw from to expand our current understanding of how individuals work on their identities in occupations and organizations.}

Larger-scale qualitative research shares some of the challenges and promises of smaller-scale qualitative work.

    abstract = {Abstract In this article the recent transformations of citizenship in the Netherlands are analysed in relation to a developing form of governmentality. We regard citizenship as a state regulated technique of in- and exclusion and a crucial instrument in the management of populations. Taking the Dutch contexts of immigration and integration as our case, we argue that cultural assimilationism and neo-liberalism appear in a double helix: they combine to form a new governmental strategy we call neo-liberal communitarianism. Neo-liberal communitarianism is the underlying rationale of a population management that operates both in an individualizing (citizenship as individual participation and responsibility) and a de-individualizing way (‘community’ at various aggregate and localized levels as frame of ‘integration’). It thus combines a communitarian care of a Dutch culturally grounded national community – conceived as traditionally‘enlightened’ and ‘liberal’– with a neo-liberal emphasis on the individual's responsibility to achieve membership of that community. ‘Community’ is thereby selectively seen as mobilized and present (when immigrant integration is concerned) or as latently present and still in need of mobilization (when indigenous Dutch are concerned). Concomitantly, a repressive responsibilization and a facilitative responsibilization are aimed at these two governmentally differentiated populations.}

The Netherlands indeed emerged as one of the most progressive countries in the world -- a fact that both Dutch politicians and citizens are proud of. In its early days, Dutch `progressive monoculturalism' was relatively tolerant. But this changed over the course of the 1990s. However, it is not our claim that a multicultural model has been replaced by a `monocultural' one: `models' as such presuppose much more coherence over time and policy levels than the facts in our case warrant. Our claim, rather, is that the past decade has witnessed the rise of a discourse that perceives Dutch citizenship primarily in cultural terms. This chapter examines the defining aspects of this culturalist framing of Dutch citizenship in comparison to definitions of citizenship in France and the UK.}

I focus especially on the personalized deployment of uneven social power in situations where space is at stake. After considering how this group differed from a history of other urban newcomers, I develop a framework for addressing their spatial effects as gentrification involving privileged consumption practices that surpass residential encroachments. I argue there is an exertion of spatial capital that represents the misrecognition of territorial claims, enabling this cohort to literally take place. I show this through several consumption practices that convert to and from economic, cultural, and social capital. A concluding discussion reflects on the usefulness of this case and framework for reinvigorating key urban–sociological analytics while confronting influential but unsociological characterizations of contemporary city life.}

    abstract = {Abstract Expatriates – in this paper understood as highly skilled temporary migrants and accompanying spouses – are generally portrayed either as cosmopolitans with universal ties or as organisation men or women who live in a local expat bubble. On the basis of 75 interviews with expatriates in the city of Rotterdam, the Netherlands, we argue that both dominant images are partly true but do not do justice to the fragmented nature of expatriates' local and cross-border involvement. First, our study shows that expatriates' identifications are characterised by fragmentation. Instead of seeing themselves solely as cosmopolitans or expats, they have multilayered identities, of which national identity is often an important component. Second, our study proves that the scale and nature of expatriates' activities depend on what aspect of life is taken into account: many can be characterised as organisation men or women in the economic sphere, moderate cosmopolitans in the political sphere, and ‘wannabe’ locals in the sociocultural sphere. The dominant representations of expatriates thus need to be reconsidered. Expatriates actually have particularistic ties (with people who are like them, based on a shared expat existence or nationality) as well as a universal, cosmopolitan orientation (i.e. the wish to bridge cultural differences). Instead of setting expatriates apart as an extraordinary type of people, their differences and similarities with other types of migrants deserve more future attention.

Such ties are important and prevalent. But perhaps a radical extension of transnationalism is also warranted: There are people who are neither ‘migrants’ nor ‘non-migrants’ but lead transnational lives that evade these categories. In such cases, transnationalism is not a consequence of migration, but rather a fundamental challenge to it. This article connects the established literature on transnationalism with this potentially significant perspective. We draw on the phrase ‘living in two countries’, which incorporates the tensions and contradictions that transnational living entails. Drawing upon diverse empirical data, we ask how we might identify lives that span two countries and, how such lives are differentiated, and why they are significant even if they are rare.}

However, in analysing young people's responses to transformations in their neighbourhood we argue that there is evidence for a more complex relationship between ‘gentrifiers' and residents than existing arguments of antagonism or tolerance would suggest. Using a participatory video methodology to document experiences of gentrification in the east London borough of Hackney, we found that young people involved in this study experienced their transforming city through processes of spatial dislocation and affective displacement. The former incorporated a sense of disorientation in the temporal disjunctions of the speed of change, while the latter invoked the embodiment of a sense of not belonging generated within classed and intercultural interactions. However, there are expressions of ambivalence rather than straightforward rejection. Benefits of gentrification were noted, including conditions of alterity and the possibility to transcend normative behaviours that they found uncomfortable. Young people demonstrated the capacity to reimagine their relationship with the complex spaces they call home. The findings suggest a need to reframe debates on gentrification to include a more nuanced understanding of its differential impact on young people.}

One of the areas of application of recommender systems is the online tourism domain where sites like TripAdvisor allow people to post reviews of various hotels to help others make a good choice when planning their trip. As the number of such reviews grows in size every day, clearly it is impractical for the individual to go through all of them. We propose the TWIN ("Tell me What I Need") Personality-based Recommender System that analyzes the textual content of the reviews and estimates the personality of the user according to the Big Five model to suggest the reviews written by "twin-minded" people. In this paper we compare a number of algorithms to select the better option for personality estimation in the task of user profile construction.},

It has been found that there are significant correlations between personality and users' characteristics that are traditionally used by recommender systems (e.g. music preferences, social media behaviour, learning styles etc.). Among the many models of personality, the Five Factor Model (FFM) appears suitable for usage in recommender systems as it can be quantitatively measured (i.e. numerical values for each of the factors, namely, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). The acquisition of the personality factors for an observed user can be done explicitly through questionnaires or implicitly using machine learning techniques with features extracted from social media streams or mobile phone call logs. There are, although limited, a number of available datasets to use in offline recommender systems experiment. Studies have shown that personality was successful at tackling the cold-start problem, making group recommendations, addressing cross-domain preferences and at generating diverse recommendations. However, a number of challenges still remain.}

Four major findings emerged from these analyses. First, self-reports of neuroticism were positively correlated with negative interactions and negatively correlated with global evaluations of the marriage. Second, self-reports of agreeableness were negatively correlated with negative interactions and generally positively correlated with global evaluations of the marriage. Third, self-reports of openness were negatively correlated with observer reports of negative interactions. Fourth, self-reports of openness by wives were positively correlated with global reports of sexual satisfaction. These findings suggest that agreeableness and openness deserve increased attention as significant correlates of close relationships. Discussion emphasizes the importance of intrapersonal factors for understanding marital relationships.}

    abstract = {Personality recognition in text is a critical problem in classifying personality traits from the input content of users. Recent studies address this issue by fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) with additional classification heads. However, the classification heads are often insufficiently trained when annotated data is scarce, resulting in poor recognition performance. To this end, we propose DesPrompt to tune PLM through personality-descriptive prompts for few-shot personality recognition, without introducing additional parameters. DesPrompt is based on the lexical hypothesis of personality, which suggests that personalities are revealed by descriptive adjectives. Specifically, DesPrompt models personality recognition as a word-filling task. The input content is first encapsulated with personality-descriptive prompts. Then, the PLM is supervised to fill in the prompts with label words describing personality traits. The label words are selected from trait-descriptive adjectives from psychology findings and lexical knowledge. Finally, the label words filled in by PLM are mapped into the personality labels for recognition. Our approach aligns with the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) task in pre-training PLMs. So, it efficiently utilizes pre-trained parameters to reduce dependence on annotated data. Experiments on four public datasets show that DesPrompt outperforms conventional fine-tuning and other prompt-based methods, especially in zero-shot and few-shot settings.}

This paper systematically presents a comprehensive survey on existing personality trait recognition methods from a computational perspective. Initially, we provide available personality trait data sets in the literature. Then, we review the principles and recent advances of typical deep learning techniques, including deep belief networks (DBNs), convolutional neural networks (CNNs), and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Next, we describe the details of state-of-the-art personality trait recognition methods with specific focus on hand-crafted and deep learning-based feature extraction. These methods are analyzed and summarized in both single modality and multiple modalities, such as audio, visual, text, and physiological signals. Finally, we analyze the challenges and opportunities in this field and point out its future directions.}

Empirical materials are deployed to illustrate how managerial intervention operates, more or less intentionally and in/effectively, to influence employees’ self-constructions in terms of coherence, distinctiveness and commitment. The processual nature of such control is emphasized, arguing that it exists in tension with other intra and extra-organizational claims upon employees’ sense of identity in a way that can open a space for forms of micro-emancipation.}

What initiates this continuing personality development and how does this development proceed? In this paper, we compare six theoretical perspectives that offer testable predictions about why personality develops the way it does and identify limitations and potentials of these perspectives by reviewing how they hold up against the empirical evidence. While all of these perspectives have received some empirical support, there is only little direct evidence for propositions put forward by the five–factor theory of personality and the theory of genotype → environment effects. In contrast, the neo–socioanalytic theory appears to offer a comprehensive framework that fits the empirical findings and allows the integration of other, more specialized, perspectives that focus on specific aspects of personality development like the role of time, systematic differences between categories of social roles or the active partake of the person himself or herself. We draw conclusions on the likely driving factors for adult personality development and identify avenues for future research. Copyright © 2014 European Association of Personality Psychology}

Some theoretical approaches even consider them to provide the biologically founded basis for individual differences in so‐called surface characteristics such as self‐related evaluations, social attitudes, values, goals or interests, which are commonly hypothesized to be less stable or more environmentally malleable than core characteristics. We examine these hypotheses by reviewing findings about potential core and surface characteristics on the basis of four criteria: (i) level of stability in individual differences; (ii) level of heritability; (iii) direction of causation; and (iv) shared genetic variance. The results from our review call into serious question the labelling of some sets of constructs as either core or surface characteristics of personality. Although certain dimensions---often labelled as basic traits (e.g. extraversion)---are systematically linked to more specific characteristics (e.g. social attitudes and interests), the so‐called basic traits do not appear to provide an essential basis (i.e. the more stable and genetically anchored source) for these characteristics. We argue for more integrative models of personality in adulthood. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)}

Our analyses shed new light on psychosocial processes yielding results that are face valid (e.g., subjects living in high elevations talk about the mountains), tie in with other research (e.g., neurotic people disproportionately use the phrase ‘sick of’ and the word ‘depressed’), suggest new hypotheses (e.g., an active life implies emotional stability), and give detailed insights (males use the possessive ‘my’ when mentioning their ‘wife’ or ‘girlfriend’ more often than females use ‘my’ with ‘husband’ or 'boyfriend’). To date, this represents the largest study, by an order of magnitude, of language and personality.}

It has been found that there are significant correlations between personality and users' characteristics that are traditionally used by recommender systems (e.g. music preferences, social media behaviour, learning styles etc.). Among the many models of personality, the Five Factor Model (FFM) appears suitable for usage in recommender systems as it can be quantitatively measured (i.e. numerical values for each of the factors, namely, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism). The acquisition of the personality factors for an observed user can be done explicitly through questionnaires or implicitly using machine learning techniques with features extracted from social media streams or mobile phone call logs. There are, although limited, a number of available datasets to use in offline recommender systems experiment. Studies have shown that personality was successful at tackling the cold-start problem, making group recommendations, addressing cross-domain preferences and at generating diverse recommendations. However, a number of challenges still remain.}

    abstract = {The ever-increasing social media users has dramatically contributed to significant growth as far as the volume of online information is concerned. Often, the contents that these users put in social media can give valuable insights on their personalities (e.g., in terms of predicting job satisfaction, specific preferences, as well as the success of professional and romantic relationship) and getting it without the hassle of taking formal personality test. Termed personality prediction, the process involves extracting the digital content into features and mapping it according to a personality model. Owing to its simplicity and proven capability, a well-known personality model, called the big five personality traits, has often been adopted in the literature as the de facto standard for personality assessment. To date, there are many algorithms that can be used to extract embedded contextualized word from textual data for personality prediction system; some of them are based on ensembled model and deep learning. Although useful, existing algorithms such as RNN and LSTM suffers from the following limitations. Firstly, these algorithms take a long time to train the model owing to its sequential inputs. Secondly, these algorithms also lack the ability to capture the true (semantic) meaning of words; therefore, the context is slightly lost. To address these aforementioned limitations, this paper introduces a new prediction using multi model deep learning architecture combined with multiple pre-trained language model such as BERT, RoBERTa, and XLNet as features extraction method on social media data sources. Finally, the system takes the decision based on model averaging to make prediction. Unlike earlier work which adopts a single social media data with open and close vocabulary extraction method, the proposed work uses multiple social media data sources namely Facebook and Twitter and produce a predictive model for each trait using bidirectional context feature combine with extraction method. Our experience with the proposed work has been encouraging as it has outperformed similar existing works in the literature. More precisely, our results achieve a maximum accuracy of 86.2{\%} and 0.912 f1 measure score on the Facebook dataset; 88.5{\%} accuracy and 0.882 f1 measure score on the Twitter dataset.}

A performance comparison is made about the regression models on topics from Facebook users' statuses and topics from Facebook statuses along with features extracted via using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) tool. Further, we have investigated the effect of number of topics found by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) on the performance of regression models. We found that SVR with Polynomial and Radial Basis Function kernel, respectively, provides better results in predicting big five personality traits. We found that the mean squared error of LR increases with the number of topics. But this increase is less in the case when we consider additional LIWC features for regression.},

The robustness of the approach is then tested by generalizing the method to two other datasets (B5 corpus and Mypersonality datasets). Several empirical evaluations taking into account the various inputs of the data processing pipeline have been performed to yield optimal model parameters. The developed model is tested on the APA’2016 competition dataset from Chalearn V2 Challenge Workshop for both Big-five personality trait estimation and interview score estimation. We achieved an average of 89.27% in personality trait recognition rate and 89.16% score in the Job Interview challenge. Similar trends of high accuracy score estimation is held for B5-corpus and MyPersonality datasets as well.

    abstract  = {Existing text-based personality detection research mostly relies on data-driven approaches to implicitly capture personality cues in online posts, lacking the guidance of psychological knowledge. Psychological questionnaire, which contains a series of dedicated questions highly related to personality traits, plays a critical role in self-report personality assessment. We argue that the posts created by a user contain critical contents that could help answer the questions in a questionnaire, resulting in an assessment of his personality by linking the texts and the questionnaire. To this end, we propose a new model named Psychological Questionnaire enhanced Network (PQ-Net) to guide personality detection by tracking critical information in texts with a questionnaire. Specifically, PQ-Net contains two streams: a context stream to encode each piece of text into a contextual text representation, and a questionnaire stream to capture relevant information in the contextual text representation to generate potential answer representations for a questionnaire. The potential answer representations are used to enhance the contextual text representation and to benefit personality prediction. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the superiority of PQ-Net in capturing useful cues from the posts for personality detection.}

Several previous studies have been attempted to predict personality types of human beings automatically by using various machine learning algorithms. However, only few of them have obtained good accuracy results. To classify a person into personality types, we used Jungian Type Inventory. Our method consists of three parts: data collection, data preparation, and hyper-parameter tuning. Our testing results showed that the k-means model has 107 inertia value, which is a good number for an unsupervised learning model as an interim result. With the result, we divided the data into 16 clusters, which can be considered as personality types. We continue this research with analysis of large data to be collected in the future.}

    abstract = {Automatic prediction of personalities from meeting videos is a classical machine learning problem. Psychologists define personality traits as uncorrelated long-term characteristics of human beings. However, human annotations of personality traits introduce cultural and cognitive bias. In this study, we present methods to automatically predict emergent leadership and personality traits in the group meeting videos of the Emergent LEAdership corpus. Prediction of extraversion has attracted the attention of psychologists as it is able to explain a wide range of behaviors, predict performance, and assess risk. Prediction of emergent leadership, on the other hand, is of great importance for the business community. Therefore, we focus on the prediction of extraversion and leadership since these traits are also strongly manifested in a meeting scenario through the extracted features. We use feature analysis and multi-task learning methods in conjunction with the non-verbal features and crowd-sourced annotations from the Video bLOG (VLOG) corpus to perform a multi-domain and multi-task prediction of personality traits. Our results indicate that multi-task learning methods using 10 personality annotations as tasks and with a transfer from two different datasets from different domains improve the overall recognition performance. Preventing negative transfer by using a forward task selection scheme yields the best recognition results with 74.5{\%} accuracy in leadership and 81.3{\%} accuracy in extraversion traits. These results demonstrate the presence of annotation bias as well as the benefit of transferring information from weakly similar domains.}

Recently, research in behavioral signal processing has focused on automatically measuring personality traits using different behavioral cues that appear in our daily communication. In this study, we present an approach to automatically recognize personality traits using a video-blog (vlog) corpus, consisting of transcription and extracted audio-visual features. We analyzed linguistic, psycholinguistic and emotional features in addition to the audio-visual features provided with the dataset. We also studied whether we can better predict a trait by identifying other traits. Using our best models we obtained very promising results compared to the official baseline.},

Our paper is a first step towards addressing automatically this new perspective. In particular, we will focus on the classification of excerpts of social behavior into personality states corresponding to the Big Five traits, rather than focusing on the more traditional goal of using those behaviors to directly infer about the personality traits of the person producing them. The multimodal behavioral cues we exploit were obtained by means of the Sociometric Badges worn by people working at a research institution for a period of six weeks. We investigate the effectiveness of cues concerning acted social behaviors as well as of other situational characteristics for the sake of personality state classification. The encouraging results show that our classifiers always, and sometimes greatly, improve the performances of a random baseline classifier (from 1.5 to 1.8 better than chance). At a general level, we believe that these results support the proposed shift from the classification of personality traits to the classification of personality states.},

Within-person variability was high, such that the typical individual regularly and routinely manifested nearly all levels of all traits in his or her everyday behavior. Second, individual differences in central tendencies of behavioral distributions were almost perfectly stable. Third, amount of behavioral variability (and skew and kurtosis) were revealed as stable individual differences. Finally, amount of within-person variability in extraversion was shown to reflect individual differences in reactivity to extraversion-relevant situational cues. Thus, decontextualized and noncontigent Big-Five content is highly useful for descriptions of individuals' density distributions as wholes. Simultaneously, contextualized and contingent personality units (e.g., conditional traits, goals) are needed for describing the considerable within-person variation.

Each is illustrated with findings from two national sample surveys (one done in 1957; the other in 1976) that measured social motives through thematic apperceptive techniques. This contextual approach implies that personality is dynamically accumulative over the life span and that it is best assessed by subdividing a given personality characteristic into variants of that characteristic, which, if measured, can accurately pick up the contextual effects on the characteristic.}

However, most studies of the FFM have been restricted to literate, urban populations, which are uncharacteristic of the majority of human evolutionary history. We present the first test of the FFM in a largely illiterate, indigenous society. Tsimane forager--horticulturalist men and women of Bolivia (n = 632) completed a translation of the 44-item Big Five Inventory (Benet-Mart{\'i}nez {\&} John, 1998), a widely used metric of the FFM. We failed to find robust support for the FFM, based on tests of (a) internal consistency of items expected to segregate into the Big Five factors, (b) response stability of the Big Five, (c) external validity of the Big Five with respect to observed behavior, (d) factor structure according to exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, and (e) similarity with a U.S. target structure based on Procrustes rotation analysis. Replication of the FFM was not improved in a separate sample of Tsimane adults (n = 430), who evaluated their spouses on the Big Five Inventory. Removal of reverse-scored items that may have elicited response biases produced factors suggestive of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness, but fit to the FFM remained poor. Response styles may covary with exposure to education, but we found no better fit to the FFM among Tsimane who speak Spanish or have attended school. We argue that Tsimane personality variation displays 2 principal factors that may reflect socioecological characteristics common to small-scale societies. We offer evolutionary perspectives on why the structure of personality variation may not be invariant across human societies. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)}

We then discuss the Dark Tetrad traits, self-defeating interpersonal styles, and trait emotional intelligence as examples of narrower personality traits which predict outcomes over and above the Big 5. Comparisons between these different personality models and the extent to which other personality traits can predict different psychological outcomes will be used to address the discussion of whether the Big 5 is a sufficient measure of personality, or whether other personality variables need to be also considered for a more comprehensive model of personality. Areas of consideration for researchers investigating Big 5 personality will also be discussed.}

College students (308 undergraduates) completed the Five Factor Inventory and the Inventory of Learning Processes and reported their grade point average. Two of the Big Five traits, conscientiousness and agreeableness, were positively related with all four learning styles (synthesis analysis, methodical study, fact retention, and elaborative processing), whereas neuroticism was negatively related with all four learning styles. In addition, extraversion and openness were positively related with elaborative processing. The Big Five together explained 14% of the variance in grade point average (GPA), and learning styles explained an additional 3%, suggesting that both personality traits and learning styles contribute to academic performance. Further, the relationship between openness and GPA was mediated by reflective learning styles (synthesis-analysis and elaborative processing). These latter results suggest that being intellectually curious fully enhances academic performance when students combine this scholarly interest with thoughtful information processing. Implications of these results are discussed in the context of teaching techniques and curriculum design.}

    abstract = {Unsupervised learning algorithms are widely used for many important statistical tasks with numerous applications in science and industry. Yet despite their prevalence, they have attracted remarkably little philosophical scrutiny to date. This stands in stark contrast to supervised and reinforcement learning algorithms, which have been widely studied and critically evaluated, often with an emphasis on ethical concerns. In this article, I analyze three canonical unsupervised learning problems: clustering, abstraction, and generative modeling. I argue that these methods raise unique epistemological and ontological questions, providing data-driven tools for discovering natural kinds and distinguishing essence from contingency. This analysis goes some way toward filling the lacuna in contemporary philosophical discourse on unsupervised learning, as well as bringing conceptual unity to a heterogeneous field more often described by what it is not (i.e., supervised or reinforcement learning) than by what it is. I submit that unsupervised learning is not just a legitimate subject of philosophical inquiry but perhaps the most fundamental branch of all AI. However, an uncritical overreliance on unsupervised methods poses major epistemic and ethical risks. I conclude by advocating for a pragmatic, error-statistical approach that embraces the opportunities and mitigates the challenges posed by this powerful class of algorithms.}

    abstractnote = {Personality detection aims to identify the personality traits implied in social media posts. The core of this task is to put together information in multiple scattered posts to depict an overall personality profile for each user. Existing approaches either encode each post individually or assemble posts arbitrarily into a new document that can be encoded sequentially or hierarchically. While the first approach ignores the connection between posts, the second tends to introduce unnecessary post-order bias into posts. In this paper, we propose a multi-document Transformer, namely Transformer-MD, to tackle the above issues. When encoding each post, Transformer-MD allows access to information in the other posts of the user through Transformer-XL’s memory tokens which share the same position embedding.Besides, personality is usually defined along different traits and each trait may need to attend to different post information, which has rarely been touched by existing research. To address this concern, we propose a dimension attention mechanism on top of Transformer-MD to obtain trait-specific representations for multi-trait personality detection. We evaluate the proposed model on the Kaggle and Pandora MBTI datasets and the experimental results show that it compares favorably with baseline methods.}

Data-driven candidate assessment is gaining interest, due to high scalability and more systematic assessment mechanisms. However, it will only be truly accepted and trusted if explainability and transparency can be guaranteed. The current chapter emerged from ongoing discussions between psychologists and computer scientists with machine learning interests, and discusses the job candidate screening problem from an interdisciplinary viewpoint. After introducing the general problem, we present a tutorial on common important methodological focus points in psychological and machine learning research. Following this, we both contrast and combine psychological and machine learning approaches, and present a use case example of a data-driven job candidate assessment system, intended to be explainable towards non-technical hiring specialists. In connection to this, we also give an overview of more traditional job candidate assessment approaches, and discuss considerations for optimizing the acceptability of technology-supported hiring solutions by relevant stakeholders. Finally, we present several recommendations on how interdisciplinary collaboration on the topic may be fostered.},

Although several studies examined the relation between personality traits and specific therapy outcomes, this literature has not yet been systematically reviewed. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to investigate the relations between personality traits and various therapeutic outcomes. Traits were organized via the domains of the five-factor model to provide a common framework for interpreting effects. Across 99 studies (N = 107, 206), overall findings indicated that traits were systematically related to outcomes, with many specific relations congruent with theorized predictions. Generally, lower levels of neuroticism and higher levels of extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness were associated with more favorable outcomes. More specifically, agreeableness had positive associations with therapeutic alliance and conscientiousness was positively related to abstinence from substances suggesting these traits are likely a beneficial factor to consider at the outset of services. Personality traits also related to various outcomes differently based on moderators. For example, duration of treatment moderated links between traits and outcomes suggesting these effects are amplified over longer services. Overall results suggest that personality assessment can aid with case conceptualization by suggesting potential strengths as well as barriers to treatment.}

Existing deep learning-based approaches, however, have two major limitations. Firstly, they extract only keywords for personality detection and lack the analysis of sentiment information and psycholinguistic features. Secondly, the information about the context and polysemous words are ignored. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel multi-label personality detection model based on neural networks, which combines emotional and semantic features. Specifically, we leverage Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) to generate sentence-level embedding for text semantic extraction. In addition, a sentiment dictionary is used for text sentiment analysis in order to consider sentiment information. Finally, we input the above semantic information and emotional information into the neural network to construct an automatic personality detection model. The performance of the model has been evaluated on two public personality datasets. The experiments show that we obtain average accuracy improvements of 6.91% and 6.04% on the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and Big Five datasets, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art techniques.}

EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects’ lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data. EMA holds unique promise to advance the science and practice of clinical psychology by shedding light on the dynamics of behavior in real-world settings.}

It is dedicated to the proposition that personality and social psychology are best viewed in conjunction with one another and that the synergy to be gained from considering links between the two fields can do much to move both fields forward and to enrich our understanding of human nature. Such interdependence is particularly crucial if one wishes to address the ongoing functioning of persons in their natural environments, where splits between person and situation are not so easily fashioned. The chapters of the Handbook weave together work from personality and social psychology, not only in areas of long-standing concern, but also in newly emerging fields of inquiry, addressing both distinctive contributions and common ground.

In the conceptualization of the self, the “Western” self, characterized as autonomous and egocentric, is generally taken as a point of departure. Non‐Western (concepts of) selves—the selves of the people anthropology traditionally studies—are defined by the negation of these qualities. Similar to anthropological conceptualizations of identity, this understanding of non‐Western selves points exclusively to elements shared with others and not to individual features. Consequently, anthropological discourse diverts attention from actual individuals and selves. A different approach is exemplified by a case from northern Pakistan in a social setting characterized by a plurality of contradictory identities. It is argued that an analysis of how a particular individual acts in situations involving contradictory identities requires a concept of a self as it emerges from the actions of individuals that is capable managing the respectively shared identities. Besides any culture‐specific attributes, this self is endowed with reflexivity and agency. This concept of self is a necessary supplement to the concept of culture in anthropology and should be regarded as a human universal. }

The proposed model extends the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model to integrate the n-gram features into few latent topics and each topic is characterized by not only the multinomial distribution over words but also the Gaussian distributions over personality traits. This paper develops a Gibbs-EM algorithm to solve the proposed model iteratively based on Gibbs sampling and expectation maximization. Quantitative evaluation shows that PT-LDA is more accurate, efficient and robust than several baselines. Our experiment also shows that the proposed model can be used to extract the interpretable topics associated with each personality trait, which provides a new way to uncover user behaviors in online social network.}

    abstract  = {Unemployment has a strongly negative influence on well-being, but it is unclear whether it also alters basic personality traits. Whether personality changes arise through natural maturation processes or contextual/environmental factors is still a matter of debate. Unemployment, a relatively unexpected and commonly occurring life event, may shed light on the relevance of context for personality change. We examined, using a latent change model, the influence of unemployment on the five-factor model of personality in a sample of 6,769 German adults, who completed personality measures at 2 time points 4 years apart. All participants were employed at the first time point, and a subset became unemployed over the course of the study. By the second time point, participants had either remained in employment, been unemployed from 1 to 4 years, or had experienced some unemployment but become reemployed. Compared with those who had remained in employment, unemployed men and women experienced significant patterns of change in their mean levels of agreeableness, conscientiousness, and openness, whereas reemployed individuals experienced limited change. The results indicate that unemployment has wider psychological implications than previously thought. In addition, the results are consistent with the view that personality changes as a function of contextual and environmental factors. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},
